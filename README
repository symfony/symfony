flexibility in mind. It allows developers to built better and easy to maintain

to high traffic ones like Dailymotion or Yahoo! Answers.

High Performance

frameworks. It is up to 3 times faster than symfony 1.4 or Zend Framework 1.10
and consumes half the memory.

Requirements

Symfony is only supported on PHP 5.3.0 and up.

Documentation
-------------

Symfony 2.0 is still in the early stages of development, but the
"[Quick Tour][1]" tutorial can get you started fast.

The "Quick Tour" tutorial barely scratches the surface of Symfony 2.0 but it
gives you a first feeling of the framework. If, like us, you think that
Symfony 2.0 can help speed up your development and take the quality of your
work to the next level, visit the official [Symfony 2 website][2] to learn
more.
