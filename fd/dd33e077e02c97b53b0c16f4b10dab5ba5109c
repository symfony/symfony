@javiereguiluz only `trusted_hosts` and `trusted_headers` are impacted by that remark (as they don't perform a simple wrapping in array. Other changes in the PR are good.

@stof is right. I was reading the changes in my phone and didnâ€™t realise that there were more changes.

Thanks for the review. I reverted the wrong changes.
