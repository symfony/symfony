Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 7.2 branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

But the header name itself isn't changed and the names are just renamed, is there any logic I don't see?

Tests pass before, tests pass now ðŸ¤”

@OskarStark The previous `TrackClick` and `TrackOpen` parameters are not actually used by Mailjet, so they weren't doing anything. They need to be passed as `TrackClicks` and `TrackOpens` to Mailjet to configure click and open tracking.. See the API docs: https://dev.mailjet.com/email/reference/send-emails/

I guess they were never tested against the live Mailjet API to check they were working as intended. I have tested sending of real emails and with the change these parameters are now working as expected.
