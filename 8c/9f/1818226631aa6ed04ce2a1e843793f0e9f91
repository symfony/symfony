deps=high/low failures are related apparently, isn't it?

I think so. I'll have a look tonight.

Apparently, PhpUnitBridge tries to fiddle with a private property `PHPUnit\Util\Test::$annotationCache`.

https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/a397c490b018095a6a4bee3b107c80d109293976/src/Symfony/Bridge/PhpUnit/Legacy/CoverageListenerTrait.php#L73

That property has been removed in PHPUnit 8.4 and replaced by a new class `PHPUnit\Util\Annotation\Registry`. I haven't figured out what the purpose of that code is. Maybe @lyrixx can help me out here?
