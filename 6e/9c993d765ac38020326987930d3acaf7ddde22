Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 7.2 branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "7.2" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "7.2 for features / 5.4, 6.4, and 7.1 for bug fixes".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

@xabbuh Looks like it passed the tests(+-). What do you think of this feature?

@nicolas-grekas rebased.

I'm having trouble setting up the tests. CI is too long to do it quickly. Is there any way to set up vendors locally? I'm currently getting an error when installing from a docker container

It is very frustrating that there is no Dockerfile and docker-compose to download dependencies or somehow resolve for it

You can have a local PHP installation (not in Docker) with `apt-get` or `brew` depending on your OS. Then run a `composer update` at the root of the project. Finally, use `./phpunit path/to/your/Test.php` to run it locally.
