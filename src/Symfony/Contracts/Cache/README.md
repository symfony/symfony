Symfony Cache Contracts
=======================

A set of abstractions extracted out of the Symfony components.

Can be used to build on semantics that the Symfony components proved useful and
that already have battle tested implementations.

See https://github.com/symfony/contracts/blob/main/README.md for more information.
