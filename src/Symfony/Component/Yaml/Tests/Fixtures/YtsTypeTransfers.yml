test: Strings
brief: >
    Any group of characters beginning with an
    alphabetic or numeric character is a string,
    unless it belongs to one of the groups below
    (such as an Integer or Time).
yaml: |
    String
php: |
    'String'
---
test: String characters
brief: >
    A string can contain any alphabetic or
    numeric character, along with many
    punctuation characters, including the
    period, dash, space, quotes, exclamation, and
    question mark.
yaml: |
    - What's Yaml?
    - It's for writing data structures in plain text.
    - And?
    - And what? That's not good enough for you?
    - No, I mean, "And what about Yaml?"
    - Oh, oh yeah. Uh.. Yaml for Ruby.
php: |
    array(
      "What's Yaml?",
      "It's for writing data structures in plain text.",
      "And?",
      "And what? That's not good enough for you?",
      "No, I mean, \"And what about Yaml?\"",
      "Oh, oh yeah. Uh.. Yaml for Ruby."

test: Indicators in Strings
brief: >
    Be careful using indicators in strings.  In particular,
    the comma, colon, and pound sign must be used carefully.
yaml: |
    the colon followed by space is an indicator: but is a string:right here
    same for the pound sign: here we have it#in a string
    the comma can, honestly, be used in most cases: [ but not in, inline collections ]
php: |
    array(
      'the colon followed by space is an indicator' => 'but is a string:right here',
      'same for the pound sign' => 'here we have it#in a string',
      'the comma can, honestly, be used in most cases' => array('but not in', 'inline collections')
    )
---
test: Forcing Strings
brief: >
    Any YAML type can be forced into a string using the
    explicit !str method.
yaml: |
    date string: !str 2001-08-01
    number string: !str 192
php: |
    array(
      'date string' => '2001-08-01',
      'number string' => '192'
    )
---
test: Single-quoted Strings
brief: >
    You can also enclose your strings within single quotes,
    which allows use of slashes, colons, and other indicators
    freely.  Inside single quotes, you can represent a single
    quote in your string by using two single quotes next to
    each other.
yaml: |
    all my favorite symbols: '#:!/%.)'
    a few i hate: '&(*'
    why do i hate them?: 'it''s very hard to explain'
    entities: '&pound; me'
php: |
    array(
      'all my favorite symbols' => '#:!/%.)',
      'a few i hate' => '&(*',
      'why do i hate them?' => 'it\'s very hard to explain',
      'entities' => '&pound; me'
    )
---
test: Double-quoted Strings
brief: >
    Enclosing strings in double quotes allows you
    to use escapings to represent ASCII and
    Unicode characters.
yaml: |
    i know where i want my line breaks: "one here\nand another here\n"
php: |
    array(
      'i know where i want my line breaks' => "one here\nand another here\n"
    )
---
test: Multi-line Quoted Strings
todo: true
brief: >
    Both single- and double-quoted strings may be
    carried on to new lines in your YAML document.
    They must be indented a step and indentation
    is interpreted as a single space.
yaml: |
    i want a long string: "so i'm going to
      let it go on and on to other lines
      until i end it with a quote."
php: |
    array('i want a long string' => "so i'm going to ".
         "let it go on and on to other lines ".
         "until i end it with a quote."
    )

---
test: Plain scalars
todo: true
brief: >
    Unquoted strings may also span multiple lines, if they
    are free of YAML space indicators and indented.
yaml: |
    - My little toe is broken in two places;
    - I'm crazy to have skied this way;
    - I'm not the craziest he's seen, since there was always the German guy
      who skied for 3 hours on a broken shin bone (just below the kneecap);
    - Nevertheless, second place is respectable, and he doesn't
      recommend going for the record;
    - He's going to put my foot in plaster for a month;
    - This would impair my skiing ability somewhat for the
      duration, as can be imagined.
php: |
    array(
      "My little toe is broken in two places;",
      "I'm crazy to have skied this way;",
      "I'm not the craziest he's seen, since there was always ".
         "the German guy who skied for 3 hours on a broken shin ".
         "bone (just below the kneecap);",
      "Nevertheless, second place is respectable, and he doesn't ".
         "recommend going for the record;",
      "He's going to put my foot in plaster for a month;",
      "This would impair my skiing ability somewhat for the duration, ".
         "as can be imagined."
    )
---
test: 'Null'
brief: >
    You can use the tilde '~' character for a null value.
yaml: |
    name: Mr. Show
    hosted by: Bob and David
    date of next season: ~
php: |
    array(
      'name' => 'Mr. Show',
      'hosted by' => 'Bob and David',
      'date of next season' => null
    )
---
test: Boolean
brief: >
    You can use 'true' and 'false' for Boolean values.
yaml: |
    Is Gus a Liar?: true
    Do I rely on Gus for Sustenance?: false
php: |
    array(
      'Is Gus a Liar?' => true,
      'Do I rely on Gus for Sustenance?' => false
    )
---
test: Integers
dump_skip: true
brief: >
    An integer is a series of numbers, optionally
    starting with a positive or negative sign.  Integers
    may also contain commas for readability.
yaml: |
    zero: 0
    simple: 12
php: |
    array(
      'zero' => 0,
      'simple' => 12,
    )

test: Positive Big Integer
deprecated: true

brief: >
    An integer is a series of numbers, optionally
    starting with a positive or negative sign.  Integers
    may also contain commas for readability.
yaml: |
    one-thousand: 1,000

    array(
      'one-thousand' => 1000.0,
    )

test: Negative Big Integer
deprecated: true
dump_skip: true

    array(
      'negative one-thousand' => -1000.0
    )
---
test: Floats
dump_skip: true
brief: >
     Floats are represented by numbers with decimals,
     allowing for scientific notation, as well as
     positive and negative infinity and "not a number."
yaml: |
     a simple float: 2.00
     scientific notation: 1.00009e+3
php: |
     array(
       'a simple float' => 2.0,
       'scientific notation' => 1000.09

test: Larger Float
dump_skip: true

     Floats are represented by numbers with decimals,

php: |
     array(
       'larger float' => 1000.09,
     )
---
test: Time
todo: true
brief: >
    You can represent timestamps by using
    ISO8601 format, or a variation which
    allows spaces between the date, time and
    time zone.
yaml: |
    iso8601: 2001-12-14t21:59:43.10-05:00
    space separated: 2001-12-14 21:59:43.10 -05:00

    array(
      'iso8601' => mktime( 2001, 12, 14, 21, 59, 43, 0.10, "-05:00" ),
      'space separated' => mktime( 2001, 12, 14, 21, 59, 43, 0.10, "-05:00" )
    )
---
test: Date
todo: true
brief: >
    A date can be represented by its year,
