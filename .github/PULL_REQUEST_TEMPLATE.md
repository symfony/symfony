<!--
Replace this notice by a short README for your feature/bugfix. This will help people
understand your PR and can be used as a start for the documentation.

Additionally (see https://symfony.com/roadmap):
 - Always add tests and ensure they pass.
 - Never break backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
 - Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply
   (lowest branches are regularly merged to upper ones so they get the fixes too.)
 - Features and deprecations must be submitted against branch 4.4.
 - Legacy code removals go to the master branch.
