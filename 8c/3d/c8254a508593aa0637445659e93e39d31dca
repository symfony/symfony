I think this "political correctness" thing is really getting out of hand. I mean it's a PLUS sign. A PLUS sign.
Do you know that there is a religion that worships ghosts and it's really offensive to them that you portrait the ghost like you do on the exception page. We should remove it.

I also think that the plus sign is ok.
