/**
 * A violation of a constraint that happened during validation.
 *
 * For each constraint that fails during validation one or more violations are
 * created. The violations store the violation message, the path to the failing
 * element in the validation graph and the root element that was originally
 * passed to the validator. For example, take the following graph:
 *
 * <pre>
 * (Person)---(firstName: string)
 *      \
 *   (address: Address)---(street: string)
 * </pre>
 *
 * If the <tt>Person</tt> object is validated and validation fails for the
 * "firstName" property, the generated violation has the <tt>Person</tt>
 * instance as root and the property path "firstName". If validation fails
 * for the "street" property of the related <tt>Address</tt> instance, the root
 * element is still the person, but the property path is "address.street".
