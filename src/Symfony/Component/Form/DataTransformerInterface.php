     * Transforms a value from the original representation to a transformed representation.

     * This method is called on two occasions inside a form field:
     *
     * 1. When the form field is initialized with the data attached from the datasource (object or array).
     * 2. When data from a request is bound using {@link Form::bind()} to transform the new input data
     *    back into the renderable format. For example if you have a date field and bind '2009-10-10' onto
     *    it you might accept this value because its easily parsed, but the transformer still writes back
     *    "2009/10/10" onto the form field (for further displaying or other purposes).
     *
     * This method must be able to deal with empty values. Usually this will
     * be NULL, but depending on your implementation other empty values are
     * possible as well (such as empty strings). The reasoning behind this is
     * that value transformers must be chainable. If the transform() method
     * of the first value transformer outputs NULL, the second value transformer
     * must be able to process that value.
     *
     * By convention, transform() should return an empty string if NULL is
     * passed.
     *

     * @return mixed The value in the transformed representation

     * @throws UnexpectedTypeException   when the argument is not a string
     * @throws TransformationFailedException  when the transformation fails
