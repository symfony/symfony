@nicolas-grekas that was my first intention, but I've realized it would result a really messy code (without doing a significant refactor)

performance-wise, I conducted some benchmarks by calling `(new MailboxHeader(...))->getBodyAsString()`
1M iteration without the second loop: 26.45s - 26.57s
1M iteration with the second loop: 25.47s - 26.14s
