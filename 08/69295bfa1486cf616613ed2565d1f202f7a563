Can you please add an entry to the CHANGELOG? Thanks

@OskarStark As the bridge was not yet released (it was added quite recently), do I really need to add a note on the Changelog? It only contains `* Add the bridge` in the 7.2 section at the moment, see https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/7.2/src/Symfony/Component/Notifier/Bridge/JoliNotif/CHANGELOG.md

You are right, no we don't need one then 👍🏻
