I think I am missing something, I am in trouble with the failing test

Do we need this? We can set it via the host, right?

Probably yes (setting via the host). But this feel more convenient to use, and considering we are already providing this kind of interaction with host for some bridge (like Mailjet or Mailgun) I did not think it would be a problem

@MrYamous for EU region we should use 'api.eu.sendgrid.com', but according to your logic `'eu' !== ($this->region ?: 'eu')` for 'eu' region we get 'api.sendgrid.com' that should be returned for global region, not for EU. That's why the test failed.
The same is true for smtp server.
By the way, what about case sensitivity: 'EU' vs 'eu'.

I think I am ðŸ‘Ž on this one, we can already achieve that by setting the correct host.

@OskarStark for providers that have the concept of multiple regions, we support that natively in other bridges.

I will take care of that over the weekend :)
