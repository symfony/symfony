Symfony PSR-6 implementation for caching
========================================

The Cache component provides an extended
[PSR-6](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6/) implementation for adding cache to
your applications. It is designed to have a low overhead so that caching is
fastest. It ships with a few caching adapters for the most widespread and
suited to caching backends. It also provides a `doctrine/cache` proxy adapter
to cover more advanced caching needs and a proxy adapter for greater
interoperability between PSR-6 implementations.
