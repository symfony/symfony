Symfony HttpClient Contracts
============================

A set of abstractions extracted out of the Symfony components.

Can be used to build on semantics that the Symfony components proved useful - and
that already have battle tested implementations.

See https://github.com/symfony/contracts/blob/master/README.md for more information.
