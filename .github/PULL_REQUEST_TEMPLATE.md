<!--
Replace this notice by a short README for your feature/bugfix.
This will help reviewers and should be a good start for the documentation.

Additionally (see https://symfony.com/releases):
 - Always add tests and ensure they pass.
 - Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply
   (lowest branches are regularly merged to upper ones so they get the fixes too.)
 - Features and deprecations must be submitted against branch 5.x.
 - Changelog entry should follow https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/conventions.html#writing-a-changelog-entry
 - Never break backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
