     * call to get() takes a long time, blocking other receivers from
     * being called.
     *
     * If applicable, the Envelope should contain a TransportMessageIdStamp.
     *
     * If a received message cannot be decoded, the message should not
     * be retried again (e.g. if there's a queue, it should be removed)
     * and a MessageDecodingFailedException should be thrown.
