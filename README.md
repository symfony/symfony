What is Symfony2?
-----------------

Symfony2 is a PHP 5.3 full-stack web framework. It is written with speed and
flexibility in mind. It allows developers to built better and easy to maintain
websites with PHP.

Symfony can be used to develop all kind of websites, from your personal blog
to high traffic ones like Dailymotion or Yahoo! Answers.

High Performance
----------------

Built with performance in mind, Symfony2 is one of the fastest PHP frameworks.
It is up to 3 times faster than symfony 1.4 or Zend Framework 1.10 and
consumes half the memory.

Requirements
------------

Symfony2 is only supported on PHP 5.3.2 and up.

Documentation
-------------

Symfony 2.0 is still in the early stages of development, but the
"[Quick Tour][1]" tutorial can get you started fast.

The "Quick Tour" tutorial barely scratches the surface of Symfony 2.0, but it
gives you a first feeling of the framework. If, like us, you think that
Symfony2 can help speed up your development and take the quality of your work
to the next level, visit the official [Symfony2 website][2] to learn more.
