CHANGELOG
=========

7.2
---

 * Deprecate `TransportFactoryTestCase`, extend `AbstractTransportFactoryTestCase` instead

   The `testIncompleteDsnException()` and `testMissingRequiredOptionException()` tests are no longer provided by default. If you make use of them (i.e. by implementing the
   `incompleteDsnProvider()` or `missingRequiredOptionProvider()` data providers), you now need to use the `IncompleteDsnTestTrait` or `MissingRequiredOptionTestTrait` respectively.

 * Add `Desktop` channel
