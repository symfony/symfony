Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "7.2" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "7.2 for features / 5.4, 6.4, and 7.1 for bug fixes".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

@OskarStark By the way, would you mind to clean up the labels? It might be related to the first description content of PR.

Also, can I safely ignore the CI failure for `Verify Packages`? It seems that no bridge packages should be `replace`d.

Can you please add a docs and a recipes PR, like done for the other bridges? Thanks
