/**
 * The context of a validation run.
 *
 * The context collects all violations generated during the validation. By
 * default, validators execute all validations in a new context:
 *
 *     $violations = $validator->validate($object);
 *
 * When you make another call to the validator, while the validation is in
 * progress, the violations will be isolated from each other:
 *
 *     public function validate(mixed $value, Constraint $constraint): void
 *     {
 *         $validator = $this->context->getValidator();
 *
 *         // The violations are not added to $this->context
 *         $violations = $validator->validate($value);
 *     }
 *
 * However, if you want to add the violations to the current context, use the
 * {@link ValidatorInterface::inContext()} method:
 *
 *     public function validate(mixed $value, Constraint $constraint): void
 *     {
 *         $validator = $this->context->getValidator();
 *
 *         // The violations are added to $this->context
 *         $validator
 *             ->inContext($this->context)
 *             ->validate($value)
 *         ;
 *     }
 *
 * Additionally, the context provides information about the current state of
 * the validator, such as the currently validated class, the name of the
 * currently validated property and more. These values change over time, so you
 * cannot store a context and expect that the methods still return the same
 * results later on.
