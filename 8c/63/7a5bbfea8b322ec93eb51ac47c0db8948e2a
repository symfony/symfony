The TL;DR of this PR is that options shouldn't have getters when they're not required, and their setters should not start with `set*`.
The options should also not provide yet another way to define what the messages can already convey (from, recipient, etc.), unless there is a compelling reason to. (There might be existing option classes that violate this rule, but that shouldn't be a reason to add more.)

The rest is more CS-related.

/cc @OskarStark @alamirault since you contribute to this component. :pray:
