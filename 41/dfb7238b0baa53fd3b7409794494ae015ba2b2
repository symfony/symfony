Did you want to also provide a map for short names that could work both ways?
Typically mapping :sweat: to `:sweat:`?

@alamirault you review the PR a bit too soon :) It was a WIP (I pushed in order to backup my work).

@nicolas-grekas
> Typically mapping 😓 to `:sweat:` ?

That's already the case, or I missed something ?

```php
    public function testTransliterate()
    {
        $tr = EmojiTransliterator::getInstance('en');

        $this->assertSame(
            'a grinning cat, black cat, and a lion go to national park️... smiling face with heart-eyes party popper yellow heart',
            $tr->transliterate('a 😺, 🐈‍⬛, and a 🦁 go to 🏞️... 😍 🎉 💛')
        );
    }
```

@stof Thanks for the review, I've addressed your comments.

I think the PR is now ready.

@nicolas-grekas Thanks for the review. I addressed your comments.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I pushed a new version

* cleaned / refactored the Builder
* added more tests
* add a Makefile (will be useful late with github and slack)
* changed the way we build the rule: use `>` instead of `<>` because we cannot reverse the text. The priority is important, and we cannot sort the list for `>` and for `<` at the same time. We can build the other list later if needed)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fabbot.io is KO, but the PR is OK (there is french content in this PR...)
* appveyor is KO, but it failing on VarDumper, So it's OK

Except theses 2, everything is green 💚

I managed to turn the txt files into php, here is the result: https://github.com/lyrixx/symfony/pull/15
Looks like we should do it :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by nicolas-grekas at 2022-07-06T15:10:01Z

BTW, looking at the maps, I'm wondering: shouldn't eg `en` be applied also for `en_ca` (after it likely)? `en_ca` looks very short compared to `en`.

I missed that point!

What do you recommend? we can merge en into en_ca?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by nicolas-grekas at 2022-07-06T15:42:36Z

> What do you recommend? we can merge en into en_ca?

that might increase the size of maps, better run the str_replace twice when needed (with the php-based implem)

I went this way actually, not much to merge. The PR on your fork is up to date.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by lyrixx at 2022-07-07T14:55:29Z

@nicolas-grekas Feel free to merge this PR, and then you can open a new PR to improve the situation if it needs to

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2022-07-07T15:02:49Z

@lyrixx Let's finish this PR before merging it. I don't see why we would merge something that we know is not finished yet.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by nicolas-grekas at 2022-07-07T15:06:44Z

Especially when this means bloating the git history :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by lyrixx at 2022-07-07T15:14:06Z

So I think the best way It to merge the PR of @nicolas-grekas (in my PR) (I'll do that in few minutes)

So we can discuss about it. But Unfortunately, I don't understand the new code, and I miss some time to dig into it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by lyrixx at 2022-07-07T16:51:23Z

I talked a bit with @nicolas-grekas on slack, and we decided to share our thought on the subject here.

Nikos rewrite all the code to be able to rely on Opcache preloading, in order to increase the performance.

To be honest, I don't like this new implementation (that explains my previous^2 comment). So the rest of this comment might be subjective. But I let you judge :)

The previous code was easier to understand, maintain and work with (see exception message for instance) 😄 :
* old: https://github.com/lyrixx/symfony/blob/intl-trans-emoji-back/src/Symfony/Component/Intl/Transliterator/EmojiTransliterator.php
* new: https://github.com/lyrixx/symfony/blob/intl-trans-emoji/src/Symfony/Component/Intl/Transliterator/EmojiTransliterator.php

About the performance, I wrote this Unit Test in both branch

```php
    public function testBench()
    {
        $t = microtime(true);

        for ($i=0; $i < 1000; $i++) {
            $tr = EmojiTransliterator::create('en'); // I also tried with this line outside the loop. Same result ($tr is cached internally)
            $tr->transliterate('un 😺, 🐈‍⬛, et a 🦁 vont au 🏞️');
        }

        dump((microtime(true) - $t));
    }
```

Here are the results:

Previous code: 0.0145s
New code: 0.088s

It looks like the previous code is 6 times faster than the new code when using only one transliterator instance. It's legit to me, since the new code does not use the translitator anymore but strtr.

But what about many transliterator? To know that, I used the following command that run for all locales

```
./phpunit src/Symfony/Component/Intl/Tests/Transliterator/EmojiTransliteratorTest.php --filter testAllTransliterator --repeat 100
```

old code 00:01.746
new code: 00:02.592

So here the old code is also faster

Thanks for challenging my proposal @lyrixx
I figured out that using `strtr()` was way faster than using `str_replace()` for the use case.
I also figured out that we can skip creating a slicing transliterator most of the time.
The PHP version is now faster again :)

My bench: `ab -n 100 http://localhost:8080/` with the script below.

Results with 100 transliterations:
- before: 75 req/s
- after: 390 req/s

Results with 1000 transliterations:
- before: 40 req/s
- after: 70 req/s

```php
<?php

use Symfony\Component\Intl\Transliterator\EmojiTransliterator;

require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

$tr = EmojiTransliterator::create('en');
//$tr = EmojiTransliterator::getInstance('en');

for ($i=0; $i < 100; $i++) {
    $tr->transliterate('un 😺, 🐈<200d>⬛, et a 🦁 vont au 🏞️ ');
}

echo $tr->transliterate('un 😺, 🐈<200d>⬛, et a 🦁 vont au 🏞️ ');
```

how would we link AsciiSlugger + EmojiTransliterator? is it desired?

In a follow up PR, and yes, I think it's desired.
