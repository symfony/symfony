/**
 * Test should cover all languages mentioned on http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/l10n/pluralforms
 * and Plural forms mentioned on http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Plural-forms.
 *
 * See also https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Localization_and_Plurals which mentions 15 rules having a maximum of 6 forms.
 * The mozilla code is also interesting to check for.
 *
 * As mentioned by chx http://drupal.org/node/1273968 we can cover all by testing number from 0 to 199
 *
 * The goal to cover all languages is to far fetched so this test case is smaller.
