What about deprecating the Couchbase Bucket adapter in another PR? It is only compatible with Couchbase 2, which conflicts with this adapter compatible with Couchbase 3

After discussing with @nicolas-grekas, the following changes have been made:

- Replaced `$parsed` by `$params` to match other DSN parsing
- Target 7.1 instead of 5.4

Note: `rawurldecode()` is still needed even after `parse_url`, which doesn't decode HTML chars. I'll send another PR to deprecate the `CouchbaseBucketAdapter`, only compatible with Couchbase 2 (which conflicts with this adapter requiring Couchbase 3 and making the other one not possible to test on the CI).

It seems ðŸ˜• https://3v4l.org/eshPt

I'll have a look at it. Is this something that also should target 7.1? I'd say yes.
